# Obby Creator Misalignment Fixer
Auto-Aligner is a QoL enhancement exploit for the Roblox experience, [Obby Creator](https://rblx.games/2913303231 "Roblox - Obby Creator"). This project is inspired by [Gabe616's OCPlus](https://github.com/Gabe616/OCPlus "GitHub").

* NOTE: this will rarely get updated unless i get randomly motivated or it breaks

## Usage/Execution
Simply run this one-liner!
```lua
  loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZxhenusZenoix/Obby-Creator-Scripts/main/OC%20Auto-Aligner.lua"))()
```

## FaQ
### Q: Will I get banned for using this?
No (hopefully not at least). [mario118118](https://rblx.name/29444141 "Roblox User Profile - mario118118") is actually fine with QoL/Enhancement exploits. However this doesn't mean the same applies outside of Obby Creator; and you may receive punishment for using exploits in other experiences.

### Q: Who made this script?
Me, Nowoshire.

### Q: The script doesn't work!
Please ensure that you are using an executor that supports functions like ```gethui()```, if the issue is not related to an executor limitation please lmk on the OC+ server.
